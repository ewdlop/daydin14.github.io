> When a **narcissist thinks you know too much**, they enter **damage control mode** because their biggest fear is being exposed. This can trigger several different responses, depending on how much of a threat they perceive you to be.
  
  ---
  
  ### **1. They Try to Discredit You (Smear Campaign)**
  - They spread lies and misinformation about you before you can expose them.
  - They tell others you're crazy, obsessive, or unreliable.
  - They plant fake rumors so people won’t believe you.
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Stay calm, document everything, and **let their own actions expose them** over time.
  
  ---
  
  ### **2. They Gaslight You Into Doubting Yourself**
  - They say things like *“That never happened,”* or *“You’re making things up.”*
  - They try to confuse you so you don’t trust your own memory.
  - They rewrite events so they look innocent and you look irrational.
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Stick to **cold, hard facts** and **don’t engage in their mental games.** Keep written records or screenshots if necessary.

  ### **3. They Love-Bomb or Fake Reconciliation**
  - They suddenly become nice to "win you back" and regain control.
  - They act like they *value* you again—only to keep you silent.
  - They act as if they want to "clear things up" (but really, they want to manipulate you into dropping it).
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Don’t fall for **fake apologies** or sudden kindness. Keep emotional distance.
  
  ---
  
  ### **4. They Threaten You or Try to Intimidate You**
  - They may subtly or directly **threaten your reputation, relationships, or even safety**.
  - They might say things like *"You don’t want to make an enemy out of me."*
  - They could even hint at **legal action** or falsely accuse you of something.
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  If they **cross the line into harassment**, document everything and **seek legal protection if needed**.
  
  ---
  
  ### **5. They Play the Victim**
  - They act like *you* are the bad guy for "attacking them."
  - They say things like *"I can’t believe you’d think that of me!"* or *"You’re hurting me with these accusations!"*
  - They turn mutual friends or family against you by making themselves seem like the *real* victim.
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Don’t get sucked into defending yourself. **Let people see the truth on their own.**
  
  ---
  
  ### **6. They Go Silent or Disappear (Discard Phase)**
  - They ghost you or cut contact to avoid exposure.
  - They act like *you* never mattered and move on to another "supply."
  - They pretend like nothing ever happened, hoping you’ll forget.
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Let them go. **Silence is their own punishment.** Without your reaction, they lose control.
  
  ---
  
  ### **7. They Try to Get Revenge**
  - They sabotage your job, relationships, or reputation.
  - They **"accidentally" leak** personal info or secrets about you.
  - They try to provoke you into **losing your cool** so they can say, *“See? Look how crazy they are!”*
  
  ➡️ **How to handle it:**  
  Stay calm, don’t engage, and **keep receipts.** Narcissists **eventually expose themselves** when they go too far.
  
  ---
  
  ### **Final Thought: Knowledge Is Power**
  The more you **stay aware and in control**, the less power they have over you. The key is **not reacting emotionally**—that’s what they want. Instead, **stay strategic and let their own paranoia destroy them.**
